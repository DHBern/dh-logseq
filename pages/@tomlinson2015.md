- [[Abstract]]
	- In the face of global change and impending limits on various resources, the need for people to move across borders is likely to increase. Facilitating mobility could enable people to access resources and lifestyles more suited to their abilities, and thereby reduce suffering for both humans and other species. This paper proposes the need for computational support to facilitate immigration decisions for both individuals and governments. Drawing inspiration from global systems modeling, social networking, and collaborative filtering, these computational tools would help match up individuals with host countries based on the preferences of both.
