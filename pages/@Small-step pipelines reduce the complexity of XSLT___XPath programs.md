- [[Abstract]]
	- As code is adapted to deal with unclean external data, it tends to grow in size and complexity. The use of small-step pipelines (a programming style in which data is manipulated through small, independent steps; a variation on the point-free and concatenative programming paradigms) has been suggested as a way to reduce this complexity, resulting in simpler programs. Our preliminary quantitative results show that writing data-curation and data-analysis XSLT/XPath programs as small-step pipelines leads to a significant reduction of the peak McCabe cyclo-matic complexity. This reduction of complexity is associated with a parallel increase in readability of the resulting code.
