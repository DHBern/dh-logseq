- [[Abstract]]
	- The UNHCR estimates that the average forced displacement period is 17 years, which many refugees and IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) spend entirely in camps. This reality has caused camps to be increasingly considered as permanent cities of our future rather than temporary relief solutions. Unfortunately, this recognition has not been matched by corresponding increases in the planning or resources devoted to camps. In the case of shelter, a basic human need, little to no architectural infrastructure exists and urban planning remains short-term. As a result, camp dwellers are often forced to take it upon themselves to transform existing humanitarian storage facilities into essential domiciles, markets, and communities. In this paper, we describe our observations and survey results on the state of and practices surrounding shelter from three camps in north Iraq. Our findings illustrate the various modes of shelter that exist due to economic and political expediency, and highlight opportunities for ICTs to improve the quality of life for millions of displaced residents.
