- [[Abstract]]
	- The Swiss Archives of the Performing Arts (SAPA Foundation) migrated the metadata of its collections to RDF in 2021, following the recommendations of the new Records in Contexts standard. This migration coincided with the launch of a new portal for its collections based on Linked Open Data principles. After two years of implementation, the Foundation wanted to assess its experience in order to benefit institutions considering a similar path.
