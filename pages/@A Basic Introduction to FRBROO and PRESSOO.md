- [[Abstract]]
	- In addition to FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD, two conceptual models for bibliographic information were
	  developed these last years: FRBROO (a reformulation of the FRBR/FRAD/FRSAD models) and
	  PRESSOO (more specifically devoted to bibliographic information about continuing resources). This
	  paper provides the explanation that is necessary for a good understanding of the formalism used in
	  these two models. It then shows how some of the basic constructs of FRBR/FRAD/FRSAD are
	  rendered in the FRBROO model. In a very brief third section, it highlights some core aspects of
	  PRESSOO.
