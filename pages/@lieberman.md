- [[Abstract]]
	- Today, our economics and politics laud competitive processes. They tell us that if each person or organization maximizes their own interests (and everybody “competes”), the result will be globally best. That assumption, while true in some circumstances, has its limits. This paper explores what these limits are. We show how the increased availability of computation can help move society to a more cooperative, and more beneficial, stance.
