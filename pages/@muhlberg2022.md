- [[Abstract]]
	- Security and safety of system are important and intertwined concepts in the world of computing. In recent years, the terms “sustainable security” and “sustainable safety” came into fashion and are being used referring to a variety of systems properties ranging from efficiency to profitability, and sometimes meaning that a product or service is good for people and planet. This leads to confusing perceptions of products where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed without child labour, while the producer uses the term to signify that their new product uses marginally less power than the previous generation of that products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards optimising our subject of study towards one specific sustainability metric – let’s say energy consumption – while being blissfully unaware of, e.g., social impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.
