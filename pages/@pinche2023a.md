- [[Abstract]]
	- In the Humanities, the emergence of digital methods has opened up research to quantitative analysis and/or to publication of large corpora. To produce more textual data faster, automatic text recognition technology (ATR)1 is increasingly involved in research projects following precursors such as the Himanis project. However, many research teams have limited resources, either financially or in terms of their expertise in artificial intelligence. It may therefore be diï¬€icult to integrate ATR into their project pipeline if they need to train a model or to create data from scratch. The goal here is not to explain how to build or improve a new ATR engine, nor to find a way to automatically align a pre-existing corpus with an image to quickly create ground truths for training. This paper aims to help humanists develop models for medieval manuscripts, create and gather training data by knowing the issues underlying their choices. The objective is also to show the importance of data consistency as a prerequisite for building homogeneous corpora and training more accurate models. We will present an overview of our work and experiment in the CREMMALab project (2021-2022), showing first how we ensure the consistency of the data and then how we have developed a generic model for medieval French manuscripts from the 13th to the 15th century, ready to be shared (more than 94% accuracy) and/or fine-tuned by other projects.
