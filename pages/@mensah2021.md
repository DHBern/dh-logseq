- [[Abstract]]
	- As global conditions cause an increasing need for people to move across borders, current gate-keeping mechanisms (e.g. the visa process) make such movements extremely difficult. While itâ€™s understandable that governments want to maintain security within their countries, it is possible for displaced people to contribute economically to development in the destination countries. Even though a completely borderless world of governments would be difficult to achieve, we argue that governments can combine policy with technology to remove barriers to potential growth from migrants, while maintaining security. In this paper, we sketch an interoperable digital government identity and automatic verification systems aimed at allowing governance structures while overcoming the limits of human processing in the visa application system in the face of ecological limits.
