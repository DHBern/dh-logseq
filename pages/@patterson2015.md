- [[Abstract]]
	- In 2010 Haiti experienced a catastrophic earthquake that destroyed a substantial amount of infrastructure in the capital of Port-auPrince. Limited national resources and widespread poverty1 have made the rebuilding slow and piecemeal. Five years later that infrastructure is still unevenly repaired and maintained. Nevertheless, the Haitian people have, by necessity, continued to adapt in order to take care of day-to-day activities. Based on a Ô¨Åeld visit, this paper describes some of the ways that infrastructure has re-emerged, gives examples of how people deal with the alternate infrastructures and discusses what these lessons entail for how the developed world frames infrastructure in the face of similar challenges caused by global energy shortages.
