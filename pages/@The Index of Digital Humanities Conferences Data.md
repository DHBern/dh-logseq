- [[Abstract]]
	- While the term "Digital Humanities" dates back only to the early 2000s, the communities from which its current practitioners hail are quite a bit older. <i>The Index of Digital Humanities Conferences</i> is a collaboratively constructed dataset and website that presents conference metadata, and linked records within that data. You will find details about conference series and stand-alone academic events reaching back to the 1960s. In a subset, you will find works presented at these conferences: titles and authors, and occasionally additional information such as keywords, languages, and unformatted versions of abstracts or the full work text.<br>This deposit contains both the "full data" and "simple csv" downloads for the Index of Digital Humanities Conferences, as of 2022-02-04.<br>Further information on the data is available in the README as well as at https://dh-abstracts.library.cmu.edu/downloads<br>
