- [[Abstract]]
	- Research in Computing Within Limits and the broader Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction community has shown the need to understand the values beyond the scientific rationality that motivates people to care for ecological limits. This paper looks at the role of religion in orienting people towards a limits-aware perspective and a more sustainable living. We conducted interviews with individuals at various Catholic organizations working on promoting environmental sustainability within their respective contexts. We examined how a limits-aware perspective is embedded in the faith of our interviewees, which plays out practically in their everyday work and decision-making. We discuss digital technologyâ€™s role in advancing care for limits by nurturing values embedded in religion supporting sustainability.
