- [[Abstract]]
	- "This short book provides a practical overview of the utility and potential of a pedagogical approach informed by the theoretical framework of Digital Humanities (DH) pedagogy in the second language classroom; that is, a meaningful approach to language learning that is content-driven and task-based, collaborative, and communicative. Designed with the nonspecialist in mind to be an accessible introduction to DH pedagogy, this book will identify the pedagogical underpinnings of digital humanities and demonstrate how this method could be incorporated productively to enhance instruction and learning in the second language classroom at both the secondary and post-secondary levels. The book offers many examples of successful integrations of DH pedagogies. Each chapter includes discussion questions and a list of further reading, and the book concludes with a reference list that could help any interested scholar explore the field in more detail. Cro's book is to be a resource for language scholars in this burgeoning field"--
