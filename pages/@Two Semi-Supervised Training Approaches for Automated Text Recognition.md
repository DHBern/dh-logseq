- [[Abstract]]
	- Automated text recognition is a fundamental problem in Document Image Analysis. Optical models are used for modeling characters while language models are used for composing sentences. Since the scripts and linguistic context differ widely, it is mandatory to specialize the models by training on task-dependent ground-truth. However, to create a sufficient amount of ground-truth, at least for historical handwritten scripts, well-qualified persons have to mark and transcribe text lines, which is very time-consuming. On the other hand, in many cases unassigned transcripts are already available on page-level from another process chain, or at least transcripts from similar linguistic context are available. In this work we present two approaches that make use of such transcripts: whereas the first one creates training data by automatically assigning page-dependent transcripts to text lines, the second one uses a task-specific language model to generate highly confident training data. Both approaches are successfully applied on a very challenging historical handwritten collection.
