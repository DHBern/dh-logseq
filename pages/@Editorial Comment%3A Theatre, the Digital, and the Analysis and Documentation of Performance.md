- [[Abstract]]
	- Throughout its history, theatre has capitalized on advances in technology, from shifts in lighting practices, to the development of machinery for creating special effects, to the advent of multimedia in contemporary performance, and beyond. The authors demystify digital humanities methodologies for theatre and performance research/researchers by demonstrating that theatre history has always employed quantitative, bigger picture approaches in addition to close readings of performances, and that digital technologies facilitate the analysis of larger datasets more effectively.
