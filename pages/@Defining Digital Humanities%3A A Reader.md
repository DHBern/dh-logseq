- [[Abstract]]
	- This reader brings together the essential readings that have emerged in Digital Humanities. It provides a historical overview of how the term ‘Humanities Computing’ developed into the term ‘Digital Humanities’, and highlights core readings which explore the meaning, scope, and implementation of the field. To contextualize and frame each included reading, the editors and authors provide a commentary on the original piece. There is also an annotated bibliography of other material not included in the text to provide an essential list of reading in the discipline.
