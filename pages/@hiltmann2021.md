- [[Abstract]]
	- While the question concerning the possible epistemological impact and implications of digital methods on the production of historical knowledge has been raised time and again, detailed studies in this regard have been scarce. Taking the analysis of the use of the Bible in the accounts on the Conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 as an example, this paper examines the differences between the analogue and the digital approach. Drawing on the method of text re-use analysis and the tool “Tracer,” it demonstrates the application of digital methods in practice and shows the consequences this has for historical research.
