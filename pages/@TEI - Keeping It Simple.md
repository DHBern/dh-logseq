- [[Abstract]]
	- This article discusses the reasons for implementing TEI P5 in a Danish publishing project. We argue that while the standard performs well as a sustainable storage and interchange format, it is generally too complicated to operate efficiently. We show how to cope with this difficulty by introducing a template that makes the daily work easier.
