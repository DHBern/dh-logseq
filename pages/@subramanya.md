- [[Abstract]]
	- Energy-eﬃciency has long been considered a “ﬁrst class” metric for evaluating computer system performance. A high energy-eﬃciency translates into more work done per unit of energy, which increases the operating time for batterypowered systems and lowers the energy bill for conventional grid-powered systems. Unfortunately, optimizing solely for energy-eﬃciency leads systems designers to make two implicit assumptions about how the electric grid generates energy: i) that all energy is created equal and ii) that it is available in unlimited quantities at any time. In reality, all energy is not created equal—its cost and carbon footprint vary substantially over time—and, as the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in the grid increases, it may not be available in unlimited quantities at any time. Thus, we propose a new grid-centric performance metric, called energy-agility, that accounts for the assumptions above. We argue that grid-friendly computer systems are better judged by their energy-agility, rather than their energy-eﬃciency.
