- [[Abstract]]
	- This study examines how academic historians search for, access, and use primary source materials in their research pursuits. Recruited historians completed an online questionnaire about current information practices and potential information needs in archival settings. The results shed light on the most frequent methods historians use to search for primary source materials; the types of primary source documents they are most likely to use; whether they access materials online or in person; their use of digitized archival collections; factors they consider important in their decision to use archival collections; and what might prevent them from using collections.
