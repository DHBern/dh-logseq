- [[Abstract]]
	- As digital humanists adopt visualization techniques developed in the social sciences, natural sciences, and other disciplines grounded in empirical approaches to knowledge, fundamental discrepancies arise between the modes of representation and the interpretative bases of humanistic inquiry. This chapter brings critical theory to bear on the study of information visualizations, and also suggests some ways to advance the production of approaches more squarely rooted in ambiguity, contradiction, and other characteristics of interpretative methods. Attention is given to the structure of interface and its rhetorics as well as the graphical formats that structure meaning in visualizations â€“ and to the need for a critical language to reflect on these formats and processes.
