- [[Abstract]]
	- To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica at the University of Florida, the Price Library launched the first stage of a project to digitize an important, special collection of anniversary editions of Jewish newspapers from around the world. This article provides the history of the collection, need for this project, steps involved in digitization and digital collection building, and future events based on the feedback to the initial project, which will include outreach, subsequent individual and collaborative digital collection development projects, online exhibits, and more.
