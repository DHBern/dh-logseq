- [[Abstract]]
	- Mullaney discusses history of typewriting in the Maoist period that offers a vantage point into the much broader, global history of a vast and complex Chinese information infrastructure developed during the modern period. Typesetters and typists in the early Communist period undertook a highly sophisticated, precomputing exploration of a linguistic technology that would later come to be known as "predictive text."
