- [[Abstract]]
	- This title offers a cutting-edge and comprehensive introduction to this vibrant and increasingly important global field drawing together a broad spectrum of disciplines. Each chapter interweaves the expert commentary of leading academics, analysis of current research and practice and several exciting international case studies, exploring the possibilities and challenges that occur when culture and digital technologies intersect. It covers key topics that include: social media and crowd sourcing; digital images and digitisation; 3D scanning and museums; studying users and readers; electronic text and corpora; archaeology and GIS; open access and online teaching of digital humanities; and, books, texts and digital editing. This is an essential practical guide for academics, researchers, librarians and professionals involved in the digital humanities. It will also be core reading for all humanities students and those taking courses in the digital humanities in particular.
