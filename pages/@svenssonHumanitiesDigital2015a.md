- [[Abstract]]
	- Between Humanities and the Digital offers an expansive vision of how the humanities engage with digital and information technology, providing a range of perspectives on a quickly evolving, contested, and exciting field. It documents the multiplicity of ways that humanities scholars have turned increasingly to digital and information technology as both scholarly toool and cultural object in need of analysis. The contributors explore the state of the art in digital humanities from varied disciplinary perspectives, offer a sample of digitally inflected work that ranges from an analysis of computational literatur to the collaborative development of a "global Middle Agas" humanities platform, and examine new models for knowledge production and infrastructure. Their contributions show not only that the digital has promted the humanities to move beyond tradtitional scholarly horizons but also that the humanities have pushed the digital to become more than a narrowly technical application.
