- [[Abstract]]
	- Digital humanities (DH) has gained the dubious reputation of struggling to define itself.  Articles trying to define DH have become something of a genre—however, more often than not the conclusions boil down to “DH is undefinable” or even “DH must not be defined.”  A question that is rarely addressed, though, is *why* DH is supposedly undefinable.  In this paper we argue that this is not because it would be, for example, particularly difficult to come up with a definition or because unlike most other fields, DH would not benefit from delimiting its domain, but rather because the majority of researchers that self-identify as “DH scholars” are actively opposing a definition.  This is due to the fact that they understand DH as “contemporary humanities,” i.e., humanities using contemporary tools, not a new discipline.  While legitimate, this view is irreconcilable with the understanding of DH as the development and application of a new—computational—methodology in the humanities.  We therefore come to the conclusion that there is ultimately no way around clearly delimiting these two opposing views; we propose to use the term “computational humanities” to refer to the latter field, and we present a concise definition.
