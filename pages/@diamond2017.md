- [[Abstract]]
	- Protecting human and environmental health from the effects of toxic chemicals is an element of sustainability efforts and respecting global biophysical limits. Can this goal be achieved with respect to toxic chemicals used in computing systems? It is likely no surprise that achieving this goal is a wicked problem characterized by multiple disciplinary silos, knowledge gaps, competing priorities and vested interests, problems between organizational boundaries, the need to change human behavior and economic imperatives, and the unintended consequences of solutions. This talk unpacks the challenge of protecting human and environmental health with respect to (only) one set of chemicals used in computing systems, namely organic flame retardants (FRs). I chose FRs because they are used in all computing system hardware (e.g., cell phones, computer cases, printed circuit boards, wiring), but they migrate from their source polymer with disposition in global human and ecosystem populations. Studies continue to emerge that link exposure to specific FRs with adverse health effects including loss of IQ points and other neurological and neurobehavioral effects, and reproductive effects. The story unfolds with one family of flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs) that are found globally in human and ecosystem populations and that have been associated with adverse health impacts. PBDEs were widely used in the exterior cases and wiring of computing systems, as well as other uses such as the foam of upholstered furniture. The major source of human exposure was considered to be foam-containing products. In North America, controls on new uses were implemented for two PBDE formulations in 2004 and a third formulation in 2013 due to their toxicity and persistence. This resulted in decreasing concentrations in most environments with the important exception of those handling a poorly quantified mass of e-waste in developed and developing countries. Here, e-waste will continue to be a source of exposure to PBDEs for at least the next decade. A secondary source of exposure to PBDEs comes from new products (e.g., my plastic kitchen spoons) that were presumably manufactured from recycled PBDE-containing polymers such as computer cases.
