- [[Abstract]]
	- The archaeological data dealt with in our database solution Antike Fundm√ºnzen 
	  in Europa (AFE), which records finds of ancient coins, is entered by 
	  humans. Based on the Linked Open Data (LOD) approach, we link our data 
	  to Nomisma.org concepts, as well as to other resources like Online Coins of 
	  the Roman Empire (OCRE). Since information such as denomination, material, 
	  etc. is recorded for each single coin, this information should be identical for 
	  coins of the same type. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, mostly due to 
	  human errors. Based on rules that we implemented, we were able to make use of 
	  this redundant information in order to detect possible errors within AFE, and 
	  were even able to correct errors in Nomimsa.org. However, the approach had 
	  the weakness that it was necessary to transform the data into an internal data 
	  model. In a second step, we therefore developed our rules within the Linked 
	  Open Data world. The rules can now be applied to datasets following the Nomisma. 
	  org modelling approach, as we demonstrated with data held by Corpus 
	  Nummorum Thracorum (CNT). We believe that the use of methods like this to 
	  increase the data quality of individual databases, as well as across different data 
	  sources and up to the higher levels of OCRE and Nomisma.org, is mandatory in 
	  order to increase trust in them.
