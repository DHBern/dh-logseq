- [[Abstract]]
	- What is the carbon footprint of streaming media? This has become a hot topic and more relevant question since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for self-isolation. What is needed is a reasonable model that considers all previous models published within the literature. However, whereas the existing models are either too high-level or incomplete and partial,we propose a holistic end-to-end model that balances the high-level and highly detailed. Additionally, most current models push a political agenda that biases the resulting calculations. We have taken a more neutral approach to avoid possible underlying motives or bias. We work our model by calculating the environmental impact of watching one hour of Netflix and showing the carbon footprint of a stream and the impact of unused energy in data centers.
