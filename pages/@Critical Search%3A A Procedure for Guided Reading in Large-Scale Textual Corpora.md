- [[Abstract]]
	- Whether they work with pages hand-selected from an archive, or keywords hand-selected from a digital corpus, scholars of all kinds wrestle with the issue of exemplarity. Cherry-picked examples leave the scholar's conclusions vulnerable to charges of, at best, irrelevance, and at worst, malfeasance. In digital research, even seemingly simple queries are plagued with these pitfalls, which can only be addressed by critical thinking about the queries we propose, the algorithms we use, and the questions we ask of them. If digital research is approached responsibly, however, it allows the scholar to choose exemplary texts for reading with a precision and clarity unavailable to previous generations.
