- [[Abstract]]
	- This Companion offers a thorough, concise overview of the emerging field of humanities computing. Contains 37 original articles written by leaders in the field. Addresses the central concerns shared by those interested in the subject. Major sections focus on the experience of particular disciplines in applying computational methods to research problems; the basic principles of humanities computing; specific applications and methods; and production, dissemination and archiving. Accompanied by a website featuring supplementary materials, standard readings in the field and essays to be included in future editions of the Companion.

	- **Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: "So the Colors Cover the Wires": Interface, Aesthetics, and Usability**
	  
	  Astract: "This chapter makes no attempt to offer a comprehensive survey of the vast professional literature on interface and usability, nor does it seek to serve as a design primer or guide to best practices. (Readers interested in those topics should consult the chapter's suggestions for further reading.) Instead, in the pages that follow I seek to develop some broader frameworks for thinking about the major challenges that interface poses for both theorists and developers in the digital humanities."
	  
	  "In the humanities, meanwhile, it is increasingly common to encounter the idea that a book or a page is a kind of interface, a response to the understanding that the conventions of manuscript and print culture are no less technologically determined than those of the digital world."
	  
	  "Nicholas Negroponte holds that the "secret" of interface design is to "make it go away" (1995: 93)."
	- ## **Martha Nell Smith: ** "Electronic Scholarly Editing"
	  
	  "Trust in any print edition, then, whether it be that made by Franklin or any other editor, including myself, is necessarily faith-based, for readers cannot adequately see the documentary evidence that determines everything from genre to suitability for inclusion in a scholarly edition."
	  
	  "In contrast to the constrained visibilities of book representations, access to questions of editorial fidelity and therefore to the editorial process itself is much more obtainable in an electronic edition featuring images of all documents edited as well as their translations into typography. In such a realm, 74 words cannot simply be excised without commentary and marks translated with a "one size fits all" authoritarian stance and go unnoticed, because a digital image of the document is available for readers to view, assess, compare with editors' representations. Representation via digital facsimiles of original documents changes access to the foundational materials of scholarly editions, the contours of expertise, and even standard-setting itself."
	  
	  "Standards are of course crucial for realizing reliability, sustainability (both in terms of being intellectually substantive and in terms of residing in a preservable medium), and interoperability among different works and even different systems. Those editing for new media are carrying on this responsibility by working with and helping to develop the new international standards and guidelines. In this ongoing work, we must self-consciously pose questions about the consequences of standardizing, classifying, and categorizing. In previous scholarly editions, classifications or the qualifying criteria dictating how an entity would be classified have been invisible. One benefit of encoding is "to understand the role of invisibility in the work that classification does in ordering human interaction" and thus to keep an eye on the "moral and ethical agenda in our querying of these systems. Each standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences another. This is not inherently a bad thing â€“ indeed it is inescapable" ([Bowker and Star 1999](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&doc.view=content&chunk.id=ss1-4-3&toc.depth=1&brand=9781405103213_brand&anchor.id=0#ss1-4-3_b3): 5)."
	  
	  "In fact, the different perspectives offered via the encoding, image-based digital surrogates, and direct critiques from "common" readers that are possible in electronic scholarly editing create a climate of possibility for interpretation that is precluded by the invisible controls placed on literary works and their interpretation in bibliographic editing. The editorial goal of electronic scholarly editing is not to find the proper literary container for "poems" (or whatever genre is being produced) but to find the medium that transmits more, rather than fewer, of the techniques inscribed and found on the literary page."
	  
	  "Though major editorial projects have often involved collaborators, the collaborations enabled by electronic editions can be something different than previously seen in humanities research, as are the editions themselves. [...] In electronic publishing, tools such as dynamic databases enable a more sustained and collaborative critical engagement of reader with editor than has previously been seen."
	  
	  "On multivolume editions of a major author's work, guest co-editors have worked under a rubric framed by (a) presiding editor(s), but electronic editions provide new opportunities for more extensive knowledge transfer and diverse yet coherent knowledge production in electronic scholarly editions. As do their print predecessors, electronic co-editors act as second and third readers, the first readers being the writer at work on creating text to be disseminated and the general editor conceiving of an edition appropriately designed for the electronic field. Since not simply the originating writer but also editors are creative agents, coordinating groups of qualified editors to work on a vast body of work rather than relying on a single master editor or master pair or trio of editors to bring a scholarly edition into being practically insures, as do the disambiguating codes of TEI-conformant XML, greater integrity in textual production."
