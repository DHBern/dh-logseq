- [[Abstract]]
	- Information systems cycles of innovation rely on global economic growth. However, a 2015 study in Nature predicted that climate change will dramatically slow and redistribute growth in the coming decades. This paper explores how decreased and redistributed growth may impact future information systems and digital innovation. While a long-term global slowdown is not certain, different countries will likely experience significant changes in their growth trajectories, and resulting civilizational transformations. We seek to establish quantitative and theoretical foundations for how a future characterized by climate change would impact information systems around the globe.
