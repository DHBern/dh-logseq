- [[Abstract]]
	- Initially, Digital Medievalist was understood to be a group of supportive scholars, that wanted to test digital methods for their research projects. Since then, it has developed into a scholarly community with 1500 members and has become an integral part of the field nowadays called Digital Humanities.
