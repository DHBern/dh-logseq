- [[Abstract]]
	- Interfaces are important elements of digital scholarly editions as they allow and direct the interaction of users with the online content and they facilitate the access to and exchange of data and information. Some interfaces are created for the human user (GUI), others for machine interaction and data exchange (API). Both aspects of interfaces and their roles in digital scholarly editing were discussed at a conference in 2016 organised by the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz and the Digital Scholarly Editions Initial Training Network DiXiT. This volume includes a range of papers presented at the conference that highlight the diverse views and approaches towards interfaces in the digital scholarly editing community.
