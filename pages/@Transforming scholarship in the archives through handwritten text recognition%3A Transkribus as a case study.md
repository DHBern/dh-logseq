- [[Abstract]]
	- Purpose
	                
	                  An overview of the current use of handwritten text recognition (HTR) on archival manuscript material, as provided by the EU H2020 funded
	                  Transkribus
	                  platform. It explains HTR, demonstrates
	                  Transkribus
	                  , gives examples of use cases, highlights the affect HTR may have on scholarship, and evidences this turning point of the advanced use of digitised heritage content. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
	                
	              
	              
	                Design/methodology/approach
	                This paper adopts a case study approach, using the development and delivery of the one openly available HTR platform for manuscript material.
	              
	              
	                Findings
	                
	                  Transkribus
	                  has demonstrated that HTR is now a useable technology that can be employed in conjunction with mass digitisation to generate accurate transcripts of archival material. Use cases are demonstrated, and a cooperative model is suggested as a way to ensure sustainability and scaling of the platform. However, funding and resourcing issues are identified.
	                
	              
	              
	                Research limitations/implications
	                The paper presents results from projects: further user studies could be undertaken involving interviews, surveys, etc.
	              
	              
	                Practical implications
	                
	                  Only HTR provided via
	                  Transkribus
	                  is covered: however, this is the only publicly available platform for HTR on individual collections of historical documents at time of writing and it represents the current state-of-the-art in this field.
	                
	              
	              
	                Social implications
	                The increased access to information contained within historical texts has the potential to be transformational for both institutions and individuals.
	              
	              
	                Originality/value
	                This is the first published overview of how HTR is used by a wide archival studies community, reporting and showcasing current application of handwriting technology in the cultural heritage sector.
