- [[Abstract]]
	- In 1973, Horst Rittel and Melvin M. Webber added "wicked problems" to the lexicon of planning and policy-making [19]. Wicked problems are problems that can't be solved through formally or through strictly "rational" means. The term is gaining popularity and is now being invoked for all manners of issues that are not easily bounded by specific, limited perspectives, disciplines, or norms. This paper explores ways in which the concept of "wicked problems" could be useful in the development of transitional systems and other approaches for ecological-social challenges. This paper looks at a variety of questions surrounding its standing as a concept and its implications for use including: How valid is the term? Does the term help shed light on significant issues facing us today? What does its characterization imply? Does it herald a new era of cooperative and effective inquiry and action or does it signify confusion, chaos, and incoherence?
