- [[Abstract]]
	- Digitale Geisteswissenschaften: Zentren und PeripherienÂ«. This paper explores a history of humanities computing over the past decade as embodied in or represented by A Companion to Digital Humanities (first published in 2004), methodologically, theoretically, and in terms of community practice. It explores digital humanities as an emerging discipline through changes in technology, as well as through evolving conceptions of the field, particularly through the lens of literary studies and new media. The article also explores how the field's major conference Digital Humanities , but previously titled the Joint International Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ACH/ALLC), reflects these changes, through not only the themes presented in conference papers, but in the change of the title of the conference itself.
