- [[Abstract]]
	- The Game and Interactive Software Scholarship Toolkit (GISST) is a suite of tools aimed at helping support and create new forms of game studies and software studies scholarship. Digital games scholars generally analyze game objects using ad-hoc methods: some games are emulated and others are recorded as video or screenshots, and scholars rarely explicitly de ne their methodologies for working with game software (or performances employing that software) or reference games in standardized ways. GISST supports game scholars by providing for the creation, reference and management of games (as executable data), game performances (as video) and game states (as frozen run-time memory from a suite of supported emulators). GISST can ingest a variety of game studiesrelated resources and reproduce them as Web documents through its CiteState.js JavaScript library. GISST is a rst step in a new methodology focused on the creation of support applications for work in game studies, software studies and game history.
