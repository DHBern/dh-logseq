- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper builds on the author’s 2015 paper ‘Information systems for the age of consequences.’ This paper reviews practical, policy, and research developments in the period 2015–2023. Building on the view that bottlenecks in addressing environmental problems are more ‘institutional’ than ‘technical,’ but that technology development can be understood as ‘politics by other means,’ the paper makes two main contributions to LIMITS. First, it offers a set of propositions about technology and institutions, from literatures including organizational psychology and software engineering, to help orient ‘limits-aware’ information technology practice. Second, it offers six pieces of advice. The paper is geared especially to students who will pursue technology careers outside academia
