- [[Abstract]]
	- In areas of resource scarcity, 3D printing has the potential to provide an environmentally sustainable and collapse-compliant means of production. 3D printing can reduce waste, utilize local and sustainable printing materials, and create an extensive variety of objects to help localized communities produce goods in resource-scarce environments. The possibility of societal collapse provides an opportunity to discuss the future of 3D printing technology under the notion of collapse informatics, and to discuss current opportunities and limitations of 3D printing as a collapse-compliant means of production. Because of 3D printing's novelty and rapid development, it is difficult to predict the future of personal 3D printing technologies. 3D printer designers should use the present to evaluate a possible future of collapse and realize the industry's potential to become a collapse-compliant means of production.
