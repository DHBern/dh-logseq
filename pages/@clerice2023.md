- [[Abstract]]
	- A lot of available digitized manuscripts online are actually digitized microﬁlms, a technology dating back from the 1930s. With the progress of artiﬁcial colorization, we make the hypothesis that microﬁlms could be colored with these recent technologies, testing InstColorization. We train a model over a new dataset of 18 788 color images that are artiﬁcially gray-scaled for this purpose. With promising results in terms of colorization but clear limitations due to the difference between artiﬁcially grayscaled images and “naturaly” grayscaled microﬁlms, we evaluate the impact of this artiﬁcial colorization on two downstream tasks using Kraken: layout analysis and text recognition. The results show little to no improvements which limits the interest of artiﬁcial colorization on manuscripts in the computer vision domain.
