- [[Abstract]]
	- Comparative literature and the digital humanities are both compound disciplines that are interdisciplinary by nature and are similar in four aspects: disciplinary histories, disciplinary structures, disciplinary ideals, and disciplinary prospects. Through a full investigation of the developmental process of comparative literature in becoming a discipline, this paper provides a comparative reflection on existing or possible problems, as well as the corresponding feasible countermeasures in the theoretical construction of comparative literature and the digital humanities in four major areas: the disciplineâ€™s scope, institution, methodology, and mission. Fully absorbing the experiences and lessons from comparative literature would be very conducive to placing the digital humanities on a path of rapid and solid development.
