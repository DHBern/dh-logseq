- [[Abstract]]
	- This volume presents the state of the art in digital scholarly editing. Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause  at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained  reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editionsâ€”and the theories that underpin them.
	  
	  The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected.
