- [[Abstract]]
	- Historians have seen their field transformed by the digital age. Research agendas, teaching and learning, scholarly communication, the nature of the archive - all have undergone a sea change that in and of itself constitutes a fascinating digital history. Yet technology's role in the field's development remains a glaring blind spot among digital scholars. Adam Crymble mines private and web archives, social media, and oral histories to show how technology and historians have come together. Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement.
