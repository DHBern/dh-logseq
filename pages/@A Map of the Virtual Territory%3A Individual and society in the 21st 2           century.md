- [[Abstract]]
	- "Uttered like a prayer retrieved from the year 2030, spoken in a new tongue, a new form. Listen!"  - Kevin Kelly, Co-Founder / Executive Editor WIRED Magazine. 
	  
	  VOICES explores the growing influence of technology on the global Christian church. We hear from more than forty influential voices, including technologists and theologians, entrepreneurs and pastors... from a progressive Episcopalian techno-monk to a leading Mennonite professor... from a tech-savvy mobile missionary to a corporate anthropologist whom Worth Magazine calls "one of Wall Street's 25 Smartest Players." Voices is a far reaching exploration of spiritual journey within a culture of increasingly immersive technology. 364 pgs (paperback)
	  
	  Everyone should read this book. For those who truly cannot afford it, contact an editor for a free e-copy: lenhjal@telus.net / jl@jps.net. More information @ wikiklesia.org.
