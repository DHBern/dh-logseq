- [[Abstract]]
	- Why XQuery for humanists? -- Setting up your XQuery environment -- Reviewing XML and related standards -- Finding your way around with XPath -- XQuery basics -- Next steps with XQuery -- Advanced XQuery -- Thinking functionally -- Modifying your data with XQuery update -- Searching with XQuery full text -- Handling errors gracefully -- Using XQuery with other digital humanities tools -- Conclusion. ""XQuery for Humanists" provides an informed, opinionated overview and recommends the best implementations, libraries, and paradigms to empower those who need it most. Emphasizing practical applicability, the authors go beyond the XQuery language to include the basics of underlying standards like XPath, related standards like XQuery Full Text and XQuery Update, and explain the difference between XQuery and languages like Python and R. This book will afford readers the skills they need to build and analyze large-scale documentary corpora in XML. A ready-reference for faculty, graduate students, and librarians who seek to master XQuery for their projects."
