- [[Abstract]]
	- Yasunari Kawabata was a famous Japanese novelist and the winner of the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature. However, considerable debate persists concerning the authorship of his novel, The Sound of the Mountain, which some claim was in fact written by another celebrated author, Yukio Mishima. In this research, we attempt to resolve this issue by applying character bigrams, part-of-speech bigrams, and phrase pattern analysis stylometric features, and principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and random forests as authorship attribution methods. As a result, we obtained compelling evidence to show that Yukio Mishima was not the author of The Sound of the Mountain.
