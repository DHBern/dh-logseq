- [[Abstract]]
	- Research on computing within limits explores the design of computing technologies that will be appropriate for a future where availability of resources is drastically reduced. In an effort to define the scope and goals of limits-aware computing, early papers discussed how such a future may come about, what challenges this future may present, and the kinds of technologies we should design given these scenarios. In this paper, we posit that these future challenges already exist today in their incipient forms. We propose that limits-aware computing research should focus on these problems to make a difference today while preparing for further future collapse.
