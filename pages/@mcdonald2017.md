- [[Abstract]]
	- Digital activism tools are intended to give voice to grassroots movements. However, a recent proliferation in one type of these tools -- activist-focused digital messaging tools (DMTs) -- have depreciated the value of citizen communication to policymakers. Although DMTs are popular among digital activists, previous research has found DMT messages provide little to no value to policymakers. This paper analyzes DMTs role in political activism in the U.S., and describes how DMTs are paradoxically widening the communication gap between citizens and their policymakers. We discuss this gap created by DMTs in terms of a diffusion of unsuccessful innovation. We use DMTs as a case study to encourage the LIMITS community to support and engage in effective forms of political activism. Technology has widened a gap between policymakers and citizens. The LIMITS community can help bridge this gap and support policies for adapting to global limits.
