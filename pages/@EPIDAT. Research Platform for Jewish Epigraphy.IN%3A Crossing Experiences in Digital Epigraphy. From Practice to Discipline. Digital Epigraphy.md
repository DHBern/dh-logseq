- [[Abstract]]
	- EPIDAT, the research platform for Jewish epigraphy, deals with Jewish epigraphy in all its aspects. This article describes the on-going project and datadriven development, since the year 2002, which resulted in a wide range of access options to the epigraphic records. Later on, the solid data basis hosted by EPIDAT enabled cooperation across disciplines (linguistics, art history, monument science, cultural heritage agencies) and other epigraphic projects. Interoperability is essential for epigraphy, but needs reliable ontologies and cooperation over several projects and beyond disciplines.
