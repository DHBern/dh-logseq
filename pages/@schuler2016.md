- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper explores the nature of a broad range of limitations and the value of coming to terms with them. It's an attempt to help conceive and encourage a shared and coherent vision of computing for the common good that does not rely heavily on market forces and uncritical assumptions about social roles and possibilities in society generally and in computing in particular. Ideally, this exploration will help engender research and action.
