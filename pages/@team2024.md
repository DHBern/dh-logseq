- [[Abstract]]
	- LM Studio is a free tool that allows you to run an AI on your desktop using locally installed open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). It features a browser to search and download LLMs from Hugging Face, an in-app Chat UI, and a runtime for a local server compatible with the OpenAI API. You can use this server to set up a development environment before deploying a more extensive LLM system or even run your ChatGPT clone without sharing your corporate data with third parties.
