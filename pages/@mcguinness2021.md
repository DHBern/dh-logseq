- [[Abstract]]
	- Technology has become pervasive in everyday life. College students are required to use internet-enabled computers and smartphones to access and interact with course material, often via browser software. However, the trend of requiring technology disadvantages lowerincome students. Additionally, the increased cycle of manufacturing, purchasing, and discarding devices comes with an environmental cost in the form of eWaste. Research has been done examining how long users can and do keep devices before discarding them, but we wish to understand this in the context of requirements for college students.
