- [[Abstract]]
	- Tracking food along its supply chain is essential to ensuring aspects of food security such as quality and safety. Food tracking can be broadly aimed at promoting sustainable food systems. Based on the literature, we devise a preliminary framework describing how food tracking systems can be designed to promote sustainability. We present case studies of Sourcemap and Provenance, two functional platforms that support transparent tracking of products along the supply chain. We argue that such systems can be responsive to resource limits in light of the food insecurity encountered, and can complement other techniques that strive for sustainable food systems.
