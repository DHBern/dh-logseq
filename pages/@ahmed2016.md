- [[Abstract]]
	- Gender inequality has long been on the list of factors that impose limits on the potential of computing, in ways that have been more and less obvious. Drawing on ethnographic findings from marginalized communities in Bangladesh, we analyze the impact of gender inequality on the stages of user research, design, deployment, and use of computing technologies. We conclude with a discussion of how a combination of design, policy, and/or theoretical approaches might supply us with tools to combat the challenges faced in these stages in order to bring about greater equity and participation in the world of computing.
