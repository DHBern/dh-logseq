	- on St. Patrick's confessio
	  
	   
	  
	  *The Hyperstack edition of Saint Patrick’s ‘Confessio’,*[54](https://books.openedition.org/obp/3402?lang=en#ftn54) for instance, explicitly offers its users the possibility to venture from the ‘centrality of the text […] through the dense net of textual layers and background information in answer to questions that are likely to arise in their minds’.[55](https://books.openedition.org/obp/3402?lang=en#ftn55) The dense net in question is effectively a star network radiating out from the main page into leaves containing pages of metadata, facsimiles of manuscript folia, or transcriptions of entire texts. Despite the impressive density of information, the information itself is not that densely networked. The relations between the texts and the contextualising information is* described*, but not expressed through the ‘hyper fabric’ of e. g. HTTP links. Even so, the* Confessio* is rather an exception to the rule–very few of today’s digital editions seem to be particularly concerned with the core ideal of hypertext as an expression of linked information, of process and context.
