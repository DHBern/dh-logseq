	- Abstract
	              Digital editions should be permanently accessible to all – but what about people with disabilities? This question is explored in this article. It is not only about the publication of data on the user interface, but also about data generation as well as the findability and reusability of data from editions with regard to improved access. While there are already concrete recommendations for designing the user interface to be more accessible, there is still a lack of specifications for the subsequent use of data beyond the user interface.
