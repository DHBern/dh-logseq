- [[Abstract]]
	- Taking a cue from the reflections and contributions made by manuscript, archival and historical studies, this paper proposes a new approach to the methodology of digital facsimiles. It asks how we research the past in the age of digital facsimiles and what are our biggest challenges and opportunities. By broadening the definition of what digital facsimiles are and re-evaluating their relationship with databases seeing databases as primarily aggregations of digital facsimiles the paper argues that the key methodological challenge lies in acknowledging the narrative within them. This can only be achieved if we incorporate the existing humanities methodologies in any data-related pursuits. The article demonstrates how notions of objective thresholds in data aggregations are in reality failures to notice and acknowledge the inherent narratives within the digital facsimiles that constitute them. At the same time, while deeply connected, digital facsimiles have to be recognised as ontologically separate from their exemplars. This influences greatly the way we research the past and a failure to recognize both the inherent narrativity and the cognitive gap will always lead to questionable results.
