- [[Abstract]]
	- The City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has captured photographs of city building projects and other government activities for more than 140 years. These photographs are now maintained in the City Archives by the Philadelphia Department of Records. Although many of the photographs were originally taken for risk management purposes, the passage of time has made them an invaluable source of reference into the city's rich past. To make these historic photographs more accessible to the general public, the Department of Records implemented the geographically searchable PhillyHistory.org website in 2005, thus providing new opportunities for education and access.
