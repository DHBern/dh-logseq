- [[Abstract]]
	- Modern communications systems rely on assumptions of centralized systems and underlying infrastructure that make them vulnerable in computing within limits scenarios. In this paper we offer case studies of issues facing connectivity in three locations in developing regions as a proxy for networks in such scenarios. We explore obstacles presented by such circumstances and future research directions for systems in resource-poor networking environments. We propose democratizing infrastructure deployment in a bottomup manner and re-thinking network architectures to be more decentralized with less reliance on centralized support systems.
