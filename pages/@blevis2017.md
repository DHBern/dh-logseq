- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper advances the connections between sustainable interaction design (SID) also known as sustainable HCI (SHCI) and sustainable digital infrastructure design (SDID), building on prior work in the HCI archive. We describe trends in sustainable interaction design. We ask four fundamental questions as a synthesis of SID and SDID, namely how can we reduce environmental harm now, alter practices to reduce environmental harm in the future, alter practices to promote a healthier society, and create new technology and practices to face future challenges? We relate these questions to frameworks of analysis in SID and SDID, as well as to transdisciplinary design. To illustrate the importance of these questions, we present and relate three conceptual design scenario discussions that may be characterized in human-centered terms of analysis as (a) finding balance, (b) resistance to technologies that push more consumption, and (c) observing a day of rest.
