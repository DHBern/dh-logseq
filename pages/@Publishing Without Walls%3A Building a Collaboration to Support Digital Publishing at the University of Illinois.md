- [[Abstract]]
	- The rise of digital publishing has heralded a new frontier in scholarship and research communications, as digital publishing platforms offer innovative ways for researchers to collaborate, communicate, and share their research discoveries with peers. This essay will explore the ways in which scholars can engage in digital publishing and the role of libraries in facilitating new modes of scholarly communications and publication, and examines the new Publishing Without Walls initiative and its African American imprint series as a case study for building infrastructure to support innovative scholarly publishing.
