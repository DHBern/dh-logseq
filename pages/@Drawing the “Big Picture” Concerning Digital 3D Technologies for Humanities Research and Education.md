- [[Abstract]]
	- Digital 3D modelling and visualization technologies have been widely applied to support research in the humanities since the 1980s. Since an academic discourse on these methods is still highly application-oriented, this article reports about both completed and planned investigations that are part of an ongoing post doc thesis work intending to drawing a “big picture” of digital 3D technologies for humanities research and education on EU level. Incorporated studies investigate scholarly communities, usage practices, methodologies as well as the development of technologies and generate design implications as well as educational strategies.
