- [[Abstract]]
	- Current state-of-the-art approaches to offline Handwritten Text Recognition extensively rely on Multidimensional Long Short-Term Memory networks. However, these architectures come with quite an expensive computational cost, and we observe that they extract features visually similar to those of convolutional layers, which are computationally cheaper. This suggests that the two-dimensional long-term dependencies, which are potentially modeled by multidimensional recurrent layers, may not be essential to achieve a good recognition accuracy, at least in the lower layers of the architecture. In this work, an alternative model is explored that relies only on convolutional and one-dimensional recurrent layers that achieves better or equivalent results than those of the current state-of-the-art architecture, and runs significantly faster. In addition, we observe that using random distortions during training as synthetic data augmentation dramatically improves the accuracy of our model. Thus, are multidimensional recurrent layers really necessary for Handwritten Text Recognition? Probably not.
