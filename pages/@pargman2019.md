- [[Abstract]]
	- In the Anthropocene, we are looking at an impending future that is characterized by resource scarcity. In this paper we ask how socio-technical arrangements can facilitate a transition from the course we are on today to one of adaptation and conservation. Taking the case of citizen observatories (COs) for water quality conservation as an illustrative lens, this paper analyses the potential of COs to form Publics for management and stewardship of natural resources from a Computing within Limits perspective. Based on interviews, participant observations and co-design workshops with a wide range of stakeholders, we draw attention to 1) the complexities of water quality management in Sweden, 2) the differing views of policymakers and citizens about citizen participation in water governance and 3) designers' efforts in co-developing a sustainable socio-technical system for bringing about change in water quality management. Our work contributes to research on Computing within Limits by identifying opportunities and challenges that arise when designers seek to form Publics and through them transform institutional arrangements.
