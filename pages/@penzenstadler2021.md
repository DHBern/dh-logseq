- [[Abstract]]
	- What do Insight Timer, Clubhouse, Muse, the Breathing App, Re- Markable and some select Podcasts have in common? They can trigger flow and they work with limited input and resources. While plugged in, some of them talk dedicatedly about unplugging and what is essential. As humans, we have a deep desire for expansion and oneness. Sometimes these two wishes seem to be opposing each other, but it really depends on how we address them. This paper sheds light on how an exemplary, personal selection of mobile applications can help or hinder, as per autoethnographic exploration. While mobile applications are not the answer, they can support us in the pursuit of essence in both directions in deliberate use. I point out some resulting questions and wonder how to live into them, maybe (but just considering) via a proposed hypothetical system.
