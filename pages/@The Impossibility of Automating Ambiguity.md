- [[Abstract]]
	- On the one hand, complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science
	  approaches emphasize that people, as complex adaptive systems, are ambiguous,
	  indeterminable, and inherently unpredictable. On the other, Machine Learning
	  (ML) systems that claim to predict human behaviour are becoming ubiquitous in
	  all spheres of social life. I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence
	  (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian
	  worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and
	  classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering,
	  sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order,
	  equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature
	  of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science
	  and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes
	  why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable.
	  When ML systems “pick up” patterns and clusters, this often
	  amounts to identifying historically and socially held norms, conventions, and
	  stereotypes. Machine prediction of social behaviour, I argue, is not only
	  erroneous but also presents real harm to those at the margins of society.
