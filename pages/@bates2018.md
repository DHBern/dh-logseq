- [[Abstract]]
	- Increasingly digital technology is implicated in promoting ever more convenient access to products and services. At just a click, user interfaces promote 'instant gratification', deliberately leveraging human behaviours and addictions, to promote frequent interactions and drive consumer demand. Behind the friendly interface, digital services hide the complex impacts and externalities associated with products and services, which often involve human actors. The lack of attachment and transparency of the underlying actions and processes contributes towards a model in which consumerism is encouraged, and workforces can easily be marginalised as part of services that promote limitless growth in consumption. We use the example of 'free' parcel deliveries where digital services hide the true impact and costs of consumer actions. To help prompt discussion we focus on two main themes for further exploration: 1) the impact of e-commerce on the social justice of delivery workforces; and, 2) how we might find a limit in e-commerce to help curb limitlessness in the demand on energy intensive infrastructures and parcel delivery services.
