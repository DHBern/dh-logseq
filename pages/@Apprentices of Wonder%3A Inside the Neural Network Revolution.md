- [[Abstract]]
	- In the vein of The Soul of a New Machine comes this accessible book on the scientists who are creating startling theories of how the mind works as they forge a kind of artificial intelligence called neural networks—or, the first thinking machines.Praise for Apprentices of Wonder"If you want to understand the latest scientific thinking about the relations between mind and brain, meet Allman's Apprentices of Wonder."—Howard Gardner, author of The Mind's New Science: A History of Cognitive Revolution"This snappy introduction to the possibilities of the new sciences of connectionism will inform readers why mahy brain scientists are excited—and why the skeptics remain to be persuaded."—Pamela McCorduck, coauthor, with Mitchell Feigenbaum, of The Fifth Generation and author of Machines Who Think and The Universal Machine
