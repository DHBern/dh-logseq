- [[Abstract]]
	- This CD-ROM digital facsimile of one of the most important manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon period offers outstanding functionality. It presents very high resolution photographs of the entire manuscript including binding and binding strips, close-ups of initials, a full transcription linked to the images, translations of all of the poems in the manuscript, introductory essays including commentary on the illustrations, and a full search facility. This CD is at once a substantial advance in digital editing practice and an important contribution to Old English literary and art-historical studies.
