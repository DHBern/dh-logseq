- [[Abstract]]
	- Cultural heritage institutions today aim to digitise their collections of prints and
	  manuscripts (Bermès 2020) and are generating more and more digital images (Gray
	  2009). To enrich these images, many institutions work with standardised formats such as
	  IIIF, preserving as much of the source’s information as possible. To take full advantage of
	  textual documents, an image alone is not enough. Thanks to automatic text recognition
	  technology, it is now possible to extract images’ content on a large scale. The TEI seems
	  to provide the perfect format to capture both an image’s formal and textual data (Janès
	  et al. 2021). However, this poses a problem. To ensure compatibility with a range of
	  use cases, TEI XML files must guarantee IIIF or RDF exports and therefore must be
	  based on strict data structures that can be automated. But a rigid structure contradicts
	  the basic principles of philology, which require maximum flexibility to cope with various
	  situations. The solution proposed by the Gallic(orpor)a project1 attempted to deal with such a
	  contradiction, focusing on French historical documents produced between the 15th and
	  the 18th c. It aims to enrich the digital facsimiles distributed by the French National
	  Library (BnF).
